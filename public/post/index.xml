      <description>Author: Guangyu Du  Abstact There exist a substantial amount of residents living in Toronto’s apartment buildings. In this paper we explore the Apartment Building Evaluation dataset, which was a survey conducted by OPENDATA Toronto. In this project, we focus on three important basics of the apartments’ condition which are: the security, lobby condition and parking area condition. And the result shows that majority of the residents are satisfied with the security yet the parking condition still needs to be improved.</description>

      <title>A Plain Markdown Post</title>

      <description>This is a post written in plain Markdown (*.md) instead of R Markdown (*.Rmd). The major differences are:
 You cannot run any R code in a plain Markdown document, whereas in an R Markdown document, you can embed R code chunks (```{r}); A plain Markdown post is rendered through Blackfriday, and an R Markdown document is compiled by rmarkdown and Pandoc.  There are many differences in syntax between Blackfriday&amp;rsquo;s Markdown and Pandoc&amp;rsquo;s Markdown.</description>
