      <description>Author: Guangyu Du  Abstact There exist a substantial amount of residents living in Toronto’s apartment buildings.

In this project, we focus on three important basics of the apartments’ condition which are: the security, lobby condition and parking area condition. And the result shows that majority of the residents are satisfied with the security yet the parking condition still needs to be improved.</description>
